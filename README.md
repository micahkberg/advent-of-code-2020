# advent-of-code-2020
Advent of Code is an annual christmas themed programming challenge run by @ericwastl. 

The contents of this repository are solutions developed in python 3. Input files are typically named "day[x].txt" where [x] is instead what day of the month the puzzle was posted.
I have included my own puzzle inputs, though usually each unique user gets a randomly generated puzzle input (I assume).

I have sometimes included test files that I used to debug various scripts where the output was given in the puzzle prompt for that given test input.

Each day of the advent calendar features 1 puzzle with 2 parts. Each .py file contains the solutions to that days 2 parts. Sometimes the second part of the puzzle requires reusing the elements of the first part of the puzzle, and I don't always leave code intact that will be able to solve the first part of the problem. Advent of Code is a speed programming challenge is my only excuse.
